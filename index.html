            <p>He directed two projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the successful SLV

               in 20 years, taking it from a developing to a developed nation.</p>
               
            <p>The plan envisioned the progress of the nation by adopting advanced technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and emphasizing
